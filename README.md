# Conditional Substitution Example

This project demonstrates how developers can structure an application to split it into separate bundles for different
platforms — or even entirely different projects.

The main idea is to show that the process isn't as complicated as it seems — and that fully isomorphic applications
aren’t always the best solution. With a bit of planning, we can build something even better than simple isomorphism.

We primarily use the approach shown here across different mini apps platforms like **Telegram Mini Apps** and **VK Mini
Apps**, where having separate builds for different operating systems is often necessary.
